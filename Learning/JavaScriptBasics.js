let ourName = "Avengers";
const pi = 3.14; 

//var, can be used throughout the whole program
//let can be used only in the scope of where we're declaring it 
//const is a variable that can never change, essentially makes a variable immutable 

var a; //declaring
var b = 2; //assigning 

console.log(b); //allows you to see things in the console, expected output in this is 2 

//variables and functions ARE case sensitive
